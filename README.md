# nycjazztonight
[nycjazztonight.com](https://nycjazztonight.com/) is a web app that displays a calendar with live jazz show info--artist, date, and time--for 10-15 of the most popular jazz clubs in Manhattan. The flask app is deployed on a linux server and scrapes ~15 jazz clubs' websites nightly. The scraper also cleans and restructures the jazz show data.

The motivation for this app is to neatly and efficiently display a large amount of jazz show data, making it much easier to compare and decide when and where you want to go see live jazz music.
